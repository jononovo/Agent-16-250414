Create a new spreadsheet\n3. Name it \"Recipe Collection\" or whatever you prefer\n\n### Step 2: Set up your sheet structure\nCreate headers in row 1:\n- A1: Recipe Name\n- B1: URL\n- C1: Ingredients\n- D1: Instructions\n- E1: Source\n- F1: Date Added\n\n### Step 3: Add Google Apps Script\n1. Click on \"Extensions\" > \"Apps Script\"\n2. Replace the default code with this script:\n\n```javascript\nfunction searchRecipes() {\n  // Get the active sheet\n  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet();\n  \n  // Get search term from user\n  var ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();\n  var response = ui.prompt('Recipe Search', 'Enter a recipe or ingredient to search for:', ui.ButtonSet.OK_CANCEL);\n  \n  if (response.getSelectedButton() == ui.Button.CANCEL) {\n    return;\n  }\n  \n  var searchTerm = response.getResponseText();\n  \n  // Create a custom search URL (this uses a general Google search)\n  var searchUrl = \"https://www.google.com/search?q=\" + encodeURIComponent(searchTerm + \" recipe\");\n  \n  // Add the search information to the sheet\n  var lastRow = sheet.getLastRow();\n  sheet.getRange(lastRow + 1, 1).setValue(searchTerm + \" recipe\");\n  sheet.getRange(lastRow + 1, 2).setValue(searchUrl);\n  sheet.getRange(lastRow + 1, 5).setValue(\"Google Search\");\n  sheet.getRange(lastRow + 1, 6).setValue(new Date());\n  \n  // Notify user\n  ui.alert('Recipe Search Added', 'A link to search results for \"' + searchTerm + ' recipe\" has been added to your sheet.

Click the disk icon to save the script\n2. Close the script editor\n3. Refresh your Google Sheet\n\n### Step 5: Use the recipe search tool\n1. You'll now see a \"Recipe Tools\" menu in your spreadsheet\n2. Click \"Recipe Tools\" > \"Search for Recipes\"\n3. Enter a recipe or ingredient you want to search for\n4.

Create a new Google Sheet with these headers:\n   - A1: Recipe Name\n   - B1: URL\n   - C1: Ingredients\n   - D1: Instructions\n   - E1: Source\n   - F1: Date Added\n\n### Step 5: Add this Google Apps Script\n1. Go to \"Extensions\" > \"Apps Script\"\n2. Paste this code:\n\n```javascript\n// Add your API key and Search Engine ID here\nconst API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';\nconst SEARCH_ENGINE_ID = 'YOUR_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID';\n\nfunction onOpen() {\n  const ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();\n  ui.createMenu('Recipe Tools')\n      .addItem('Search for Recipes', 'searchRecipes')\n      .addToUi();\n}\n\nfunction searchRecipes() {\n  const ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();\n  const response = ui.prompt('Recipe Search', 'Enter a recipe or ingredient to search for:', ui.ButtonSet.OK_CANCEL);\n  \n  if (response.getSelectedButton() == ui.Button.CANCEL) {\n    return;\n  }\n  \n  const searchTerm = response.getResponseText();\n  const results = performSearch(searchTerm);\n  \n  if (results && results.length > 0) {\n    addRecipesToSheet(results);\n    ui.alert('Success', `Added ${results.length} recipes to your sheet.`, ui.ButtonSet.OK);\n  } else {\n    ui.alert('No Results', 'No recipes found for that search term.', ui.ButtonSet.OK);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction performSearch(searchTerm) {\n  const url = `https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?key=${API_KEY}&cx=${SEARCH_ENGINE_ID}&q=${encodeURIComponent(searchTerm + \" recipe\")}&num=5`;\n  \n  try {\n    const response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url);\n    const data = JSON.parse(response.getContentText());\n    \n    if (data.items && data.items.length > 0) {\n      return data.items.map(item => ({\n        title: item.title,\n        link: item.link,\n        snippet: item.snippet,\n        source: item.displayLink\n      }));\n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    Logger.log('Error performing search: ' + error);\n  }\n  \n  return [];\n}\n\nfunction addRecipesToSheet(recipes) {\n  const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet();\n  const lastRow = Math.max(sheet.getLastRow(), 1);\n  \n  recipes.forEach((recipe, index) => {\n    const row = lastRow + 1 + index;\n    \n    // Add basic recipe information\n    sheet.getRange(row, 1).setValue(recipe.title);\n    sheet.getRange(row, 2).setValue(recipe.link);\n    sheet.getRange(row, 5).setValue(recipe.source);\n    sheet.getRange(row, 6).setValue(new Date());\n    \n    // Make the URL clickable\n    sheet.getRange(row, 2).setFormula(`=HYPERLINK(\"${recipe.link}\",\"${recipe.link}\")`);\n    \n    // Add snippet as temporary description\n    sheet.getRange(row, 3).setValue(recipe.snippet);\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### Step 6: Replace API credentials\n1. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key\n2. Replace `YOUR_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID` with your search engine ID\n\n### Step 7: Save and run the script\n1. Save the script\n2. Refresh your Google Sheet\n3. Use the \"Recipe Tools\" menu to search for recipes\n\n### Optional Enhancement: Recipe Scraping\nFor a complete solution that extracts ingredients and instructions, you would need to add web scraping functionality. This is more complex and would require:\n\n```javascript\nfunction scrapeRecipeDetails(url) {\n  try {\n    const response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url);\n    const html = response.getContentText();\n    \n    // This is a simplified example - actual scraping would need more robust parsing\n    let ingredients = '';\n    let instructions = '';\n    \n    // Very basic extraction (would need to be customized per site)\n    if (html.includes('<ul class=\"ingredients\">')) {\n      ingredients = html.split('<ul class=\"ingredients\">')[1].split('</ul>')[0];\n      ingredients = ingredients.replace(/<li>/g, '').replace(/<\\/li>/g, '\\n');\n    }\n    \n    if (html.includes('<ol class=\"instructions\">')) {\n      instructions = html.split('<ol class=\"instructions\">')[1].split('</ol>')[0];\n      instructions = instructions.replace(/<li>/g, '').replace(/<\\/li>/g, '\\n');\n    }\n    \n    return {\n      ingredients: ingredients,\n      instructions: instructions\n    };\n  } catch (error) {\n    Logger.log('Error scraping recipe: ' + error);\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote: Web scraping is site-specific and would need to be customized for each recipe website. For a more robust solution, you might consider using a recipe API service like Spoonacular or Edamam instead of scraping."

You've implemented an efficient solution using the mathematical formula n(n+1)/2 rather than an iterative approach.\n\nYour code includes:\n- A well-documented function with clear docstring\n- Proper input validation (checking for positive integers)\n- Error handling with try/except for non-integer inputs\n- Clear output formatting\n\nThe integer division operator (//) is appropriate here since the formula n(n+1)/2 always produces an integer result for integer inputs.\n\nThis is a clean, efficient implementation that handles edge cases appropriately. Well done!"

The tracking number is 1Z999AA10123456784. Current status: In Transit. Estimated delivery: June 14th. Would you like the tracking link?\"\n```\n\n**Returns Process:**\n```\nBot: \"Welcome to [Store Name] support.
