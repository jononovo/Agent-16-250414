# To-Clean Directory

This directory contains components and code that need evaluation, consolidation, or removal. 

## Purpose

During the codebase reorganization, we identified several components that may be:
1. Duplicated across different directories
2. Outdated or no longer used
3. Need refactoring to fit the new architecture
4. Candidates for consolidation with similar components

## Organization

Components are temporarily moved here with their original folder structure preserved to help with the assessment process.

## Next Steps

Each component in this directory should be:
1. Evaluated for current usage in the application
2. Either refactored and moved to the appropriate location in the new structure
3. Or marked for removal if determined to be obsolete

## Flow Components

The `/flow` subdirectory contains components related to the workflow visualization and editing experience that need assessment.
