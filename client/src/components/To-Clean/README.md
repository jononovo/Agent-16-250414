# To-Clean Components

This folder contains components that might be duplicated, outdated, or need further assessment before deciding whether to keep, refactor, or remove them.

## Guidelines for Review

When reviewing these components:

1. Check if the component is being used anywhere in the codebase
2. Look for similar components that might serve the same purpose
3. Decide whether to:
   - Move the component to an appropriate folder
   - Refactor it to follow current patterns
   - Merge it with similar components
   - Remove it entirely if it's not used

## Components Included

The components in this folder were moved here during a code cleanup initiative because they appeared to be:
- Duplicated in multiple places
- Similar to other components but with slight variations
- Potentially outdated or superseded by newer implementations
