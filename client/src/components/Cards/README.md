# Cards Components

This folder contains all card components used throughout the application, organized by their domain and purpose.

## Structure

- **agent-cards/**: Components for displaying agent information in card format
- **workflow-cards/**: Components for displaying workflow information in card format
- **node-cards/**: Components for displaying node information in card format

## Guidelines

When adding new card components:

1. Place them in the appropriate subfolder based on their domain
2. Follow consistent naming conventions (e.g., `EntityNameCard.tsx`)
3. Ensure they use shared styling patterns where appropriate
4. Keep the card components focused on display, with minimal business logic

This organization helps maintain a clear separation between different types of card components while providing a centralized location for all card-related UI elements.
