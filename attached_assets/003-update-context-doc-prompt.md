# Update Replit Dev Agent Context Document

Analyze the current codebase and compare it with the existing Replit dev agent context document. Create an updated version that accurately reflects the latest architecture, structure, and implementation patterns.

## Update Tasks

1. **Code Analysis**
   - Scan the current codebase structure
   - Identify changes to critical files and components
   - Detect changes in technology stack or dependencies
   - Find modifications to data flow patterns
   - Note updated API contracts and interfaces

2. **Document Updates**
   - Update technology stack versions and configuration details
   - Revise critical file paths and function descriptions
   - Refresh data flow diagrams or descriptions
   - Update storage and state management patterns
   - Revise common errors and solutions

3. **Maintain Focus**
   - Keep the document concise and focused on essential information
   - Preserve the existing document structure
   - Remove obsolete information
   - Add new critical components
   - Ensure all file paths and function names are current

## File Management Instructions

1. **Naming Convention**: Save the updated document as `replit-dev-agent-context-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md` where:
   - YYYY = year (4 digits)
   - MM = month (2 digits)
   - DD = day (2 digits)
   - HH = hour in 24-hour format (2 digits)
   - MM = minute (2 digits)

2. **Update Log**:
   - Add an "Update History" section at the end of the document
   - Include the date and brief summary of changes
   - Note which files or components were significantly modified
   - Reference the previous version's filename

3. **System Prompt Integration**:
   - After creating the updated version, immediately update the Replit AI system prompt
   - Replace the previous context document with the newest version
   - Add a comment in the system prompt with the document's filename and update date
   - Test the AI's understanding of the updated components

4. **Version Retention**:
   - Keep the previous 2-3 versions for reference
   - Consider archiving older versions in a dedicated directory
   - If using a continuous integration system, automate the context document update process
