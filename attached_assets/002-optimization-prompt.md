# Optimize AI Agent Context Document

Enhance the initial AI agent context document to make it more effective for AI assistants. Focus only on improvements that directly increase usefulness for code understanding and assistance.

## Enhancement Tasks

1. **Technology Clarification**
   - Verify technology versions and compatibility constraints
   - Add critical configuration requirements
   - Clarify data storage patterns and access methods
   - Identify authentication mechanisms and security patterns

2. **Component Relationships**
   - Add clear dependency mapping between critical components
   - Specify data transformation points
   - Note API boundaries and contract details
   - Include initialization sequence where relevant

3. **Pattern Examples**
   - Add 1-2 short code snippets (3-5 lines) for unique patterns
   - Include brief examples of naming conventions
   - Note testing approaches for different components

4. **AI Reference Optimization**
   - Add explicit file path references for quick lookup
   - Include common error patterns and solutions
   - Note differences between environments (dev/prod)

Keep the document concise while improving precision. Remove any sections that don't directly help with code navigation or understanding.
