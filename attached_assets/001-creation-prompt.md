# Create AI Agent Context Document

Analyze our codebase to create a concise context document that helps AI agents understand our system architecture. Focus only on essential information needed for AI assistance.

## Document Structure

Create a markdown document with these sections:

1. **Application Overview**: Purpose and high-level functionality (2-3 sentences)

2. **Technology Stack**:
   - Frontend framework(s) and major libraries
   - Backend language(s) and framework(s)
   - Database/storage solutions and patterns
   - Critical third-party dependencies and integrations
   - Infrastructure/deployment approach

3. **Key Files and Directories**: 5-10 most critical code locations with brief explanations

4. **Critical Functions**: 5-7 core functions that define primary business logic

5. **Data Flow**: How information moves through the system (focus on main paths)

6. **State Management**: How application state is maintained and synchronized

7. **Common Development Tasks**: Steps for frequent operations (keep very brief)

8. **Known Issues**: Only include major limitations or technical constraints

Keep the document minimal (target: 1500-2000 words) and focused only on what an AI assistant needs to navigate and understand the codebase effectively.

Save as `ai-agent-context-YYYYMMDD.md` with today's date.
