Advantages of Simple AI Dev Approach:
Complete Component Library: They offer a full set of ready-to-use components designed specifically for AI workflow UIs
Interactive Elements: Their in-place editing capabilities (like editable handles, resizable nodes) provide a better user experience
Established Patterns: They've already solved many of the problems we're facing with node UI consistency
Built on React Flow: Since we're already using React Flow, adoption would be relatively straightforward
Key Components to Adopt:
Node Templates: Their node templates with consistent styling would bring uniformity
Editable Handles: Allow connection points to be edited directly
Resizable Nodes: Better user control over node sizing
Status Edges: Visual indication of data flow status
Model Selector: Standardized component for AI model selection
I strongly recommend this approach over creating our own system from scratch. It would provide a professional, cohesive look while reducing development time.

3. Recommended Process
I suggest implementing this upgrade in these phases:

Phase 1: Documentation & Standards
Create a new NODE_STANDARDS.md document that outlines:

Node component structure
UI conventions and style guidelines
Required properties and behaviors
Example implementations
Create a components/nodes/base directory with:

Base node templates (following Simple AI Dev patterns)
Shared components for handles, headers, etc.
Utility functions for node UI interaction
Phase 2: Create Core Components
Implement these foundational components:

BaseNode.tsx - A standardized wrapper for all nodes
NodeHeader.tsx - Consistent header with title, controls
NodeContent.tsx - Standard content container
NodeHandle.tsx - Unified input/output connection points
NodeControls.tsx - Standard UI controls (sliders, inputs, etc.)
Add interactive elements from Simple AI Dev:

Editable handles
Resizable nodes
Status edges
Phase 3: Migration & Expansion
Create a migration plan for existing nodes
Build a node showcase/playground to demonstrate available components
Implement node templates for common categories (AI, Data, Workflow)
I believe this approach would provide the most value while maintaining consistency with the direction you're already heading. The Simple AI Dev components would give us a professional foundation to build upon, and clear documentation would ensure all future node development follows the same patterns.
