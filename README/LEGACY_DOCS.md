# Legacy Documentation Reference

This file serves as a reference for developers who might be looking for previously available documentation files that have been consolidated or renamed for better organization.

## Updated Documentation Structure

The project documentation has been reorganized and consolidated for clarity. Here's where to find information that was previously in separate files:

| Old File | New Location |
|----------|-------------|
| NODES_SYSTEM.md | See [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md) - Node System section |
| ARCHITECTURE.md | See [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md) - Core Architecture section |
| DEVELOPMENT.md | See [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md) - Development Guide section |
| TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md | See [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md) - Technical Reference section |
| AI_MODEL_CONTEXT.md | See [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md) - Technical Reference section |
| README-Quick-Start.md | See [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md) - Quick Start section |
| README-Comprehensive.md | See [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md) |
| README.md (in README folder) | See [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md) |
| REFERENCE.md | See [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md) - Technical Reference section |

2. **ai-agent-context-20250423.md** - Concise context document for AI assistants with:
   - Application overview
   - Technology stack
   - Key files and directories
   - Critical functions
   - Data flow
   - State management
   - Common development tasks
   - Known issues

3. **ai-agent-context-optimized-20250423.md** - Enhanced AI assistant context with:

## Why We Consolidated

The documentation was consolidated to:
1. Eliminate duplication of information
2. Create a clearer information hierarchy
3. Make it easier to keep documentation in sync with code changes
4. Improve the overall developer experience
5. Provide a single source of truth for documentation
