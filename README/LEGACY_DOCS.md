# Legacy Documentation Reference

This file serves as a reference for developers who might be looking for previously available documentation files that have been consolidated or renamed for better organization.

## Updated Documentation Structure

The project documentation has been reorganized and consolidated for clarity. Here's where to find information that was previously in separate files:

| Old File | New Location |
|----------|-------------|
| NODES_SYSTEM.md | See [README-Comprehensive.md](./README-Comprehensive.md) for node system overview and [REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md) for technical details |
| ARCHITECTURE.md | See [README-Comprehensive.md](./README-Comprehensive.md) for architectural overview |
| DEVELOPMENT.md | See [README-Quick-Start.md](./README-Quick-Start.md) for getting started and [REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md) for development patterns |
| TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md | Consolidated into [REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md) |
| AI_MODEL_CONTEXT.md | Consolidated into [REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md) |

## Current Documentation Files

1. **README-Quick-Start.md**
   - Concise guide to get up and running quickly
   - Installation and first steps

2. **README-Comprehensive.md**
   - Detailed explanation of the project architecture
   - Node system structure and organization
   - UI guidelines and patterns

3. **REFERENCE.md**
   - Technical reference for developers and AI assistants
   - Data structures and interfaces
   - Common code patterns
   - System functions reference

## Why We Consolidated

The documentation was consolidated to:
1. Reduce duplication of information
2. Create a clearer information hierarchy
3. Make it easier to keep documentation in sync with code changes
4. Improve the overall developer experience
