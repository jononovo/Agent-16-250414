## Note About Updated Architecture

Please be aware that the current version of the application:

1. Uses **Replit Key-Value Database** for persistence, not PostgreSQL
2. Has removed the test files `node-system-demo.tsx` and `agent-test.tsx`
3. Has updated the Node Hover Menu with a 400ms delay and positioning 20px from nodes
4. Uses the Enhanced Node Pattern that avoids settings drawer closing when editing form fields
