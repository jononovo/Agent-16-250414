# Legacy Documentation Reference

This file serves as a reference for developers who might be looking for previously available documentation files that have been consolidated or renamed for better organization.

## Updated Documentation Structure

The project documentation has been reorganized and consolidated for clarity. Here's where to find information that was previously in separate files:

| Old File | New Location |
|----------|-------------|
| NODES_SYSTEM.md | See [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md) - Node System section |
| ARCHITECTURE.md | See [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md) - Core Architecture section |
| DEVELOPMENT.md | See [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md) - Development Guide section |
| TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md | See [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md) - Technical Reference section |
| AI_MODEL_CONTEXT.md | See [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md) - Technical Reference section |
| README-Quick-Start.md | See [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md) - Quick Start section |
| README-Comprehensive.md | See [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md) |
| README.md (in README folder) | See [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md) |
| REFERENCE.md | See [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md) - Technical Reference section |

## Current Documentation Structure

1. **DOCUMENTATION.md** - Single comprehensive documentation file with:
   - Quick Start Guide
   - Core Architecture
   - Node System details
   - Storage System
   - UI Guidelines
   - Technical Reference (including data structures and code patterns)
   - Development Guide
   - Troubleshooting

## Why We Consolidated

The documentation was consolidated to:
1. Eliminate duplication of information
2. Create a clearer information hierarchy
3. Make it easier to keep documentation in sync with code changes
4. Improve the overall developer experience
5. Provide a single source of truth for documentation
